# BayesianMCMC

A Bayesian framework for quantifying endmember contributions in geochemical mixing problems using multi-isotope data.

## Features

- **Forward Modeling**: Predict mixed isotopic compositions from endmember proportions
- **MCMC Inversion**: Bayesian parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Uncertainty quantification through stochastic sampling
- **Concentration-Weighted Mixing**: Properly accounts for element concentrations in mixing calculations

## Quick Start (Linux)

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
